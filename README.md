# 🚀 Project Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!  
I am **Dago Palmera**, a Systems Engineering student and aspiring developer.  
This repository serves as a **central index** for my programming and technology projects, organized by categories and languages.

My goal is to keep learning, experiment with different technologies, and showcase my progress on the path to becoming a full stack developer.
